### My Timer page:

This page contains the main functionality of FocusTime, where the user can set a period of time for them to focus on a certain task while also having the option to play music. There is a _Project_ and _Task_ selector in which the user can choose an existing task or create a new one, and have the option of having it under a particular project or no project at all. When setting the timer, the user is prompted to set the values of the time in this page but also have the option to set the time according to the album length through the music page. On initial load, there will be no album selected but there will be a message on the widget telling the user to navigate to the music page so that an album can be chosen. The users can also write down important notes during their focus period which can be saved for that session once the timer is done and the user logs the percentage of the work they completed.  

### My Music page:

This page contains the main functionality of the music aspect for FocusTime. This page represents an eventual implentation of an API like _Spotify_, where the user can log in and select any albums that suit their tastes or mood for the session. Once an album is selected, the user can view the details of the album such as the total length as well as being able to scroll down and view the songs contained in that particular album. The user can choose to add an album to the song queue which will update the widget in the timer page and display the list of songs there which the user can play and listen to. The user can also base their workflow off an album by choosing to set the timer to the album length.
